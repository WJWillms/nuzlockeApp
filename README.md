This is a React Native Project that was meant to help people make teams from the Pokemon they have caught in Pokemon Soulocke runs, based on the Mr. Fruit(Youtuber) ruleset. This started out as just something to run on my own computer but has recently evolved into a website. Current version supports the Sun/Moon Pokedex.

# Website: [SoulockeForge](https://soulockeforge.netlify.app/)

# Known Issues:
1.  This was originally desined to be perfectly sized to my screen so it's not fully compatible to all users and their screen sizes, especially mobile.
3.  Some sprites tend to dissappear.
4.  Untested swapping Mono flying type in Flyer Edits menu.

# Possible Updates:
1. More tweaking for the website to work on more monitor sizes and possibly even mobile.
2. Adding in a game selection choice to choose between different pokedex's.
3. Easier typing adjustments for pokemon like Arceus or Silvally.
5. Ability to evolve a pokemon from the team generation page.

# How to use:
![Home Page](/assets/readMePictures/Home_Page.png)
This is the home page. Just a nice simple welcome page to get you into the program.
![Trainer 1 Choices](/assets/readMePictures/Trainer1.png)
This is what the next page will look like. Here the user will select all of the Pokemon for Trainer 1 and then select Confirm at the bottom.
![Trainer 2 Choices](/assets/readMePictures/Trainer2.png)
Once the selections have been input for Trainer 1, the input selection for Trainer 2 will begin. You will notice in the top right it shows the current Pokemon that your next choice will be matching to from Trainer 1. Also in the Confirm button you will notice what number choice you are on. You won't be able to make more choices thatn trainer 1 to keep teams at the same size.
![Search](/assets/readMePictures/Search_Feature.png)
If you are having problems finding a certain Pokemon you can use the search bar at the top. It searches for all varitions of what you search for so if you can only remember part of the name you can still find it. For example if you can only remember the "Chu" in "Pikachu" you can search for "Chu" and still find it.
![Soulocke Team View](/assets/readMePictures/Teams_Display.png)
This is the page that will display all of the teams available after selecting confirm on Trainer 2. You can rotate between the teams using the previous and next buttons at the top, and refine the results by using the options bar. The options there are again based off of the Mr. Fruit ruleset and should be self explanitory outside of Focus. Focus is an option to choose a pair and that pair will be in every variation of teams that are presented. Also if you notice some typings in the Weaknesses section may have a glow to them. This is meant as a warning that this type doesn't have a match in the resistances section, or put simply, no pokemon on that team resist that type.
![Flyer Edits](/assets/readMePictures/Flyer_Edits.png)
This is the Flyer Edits menu that allows the user to swap the Primary and Secondary typing of a Pokemon. The red box indicates the pokemon being modified in the pair.
![Radar Charts](/assets/readMePictures/Radar_Charts.png)
The radar charts in the stats section are interactable and can be used to show multiple pokemon at one time, a single pokemon, The entire teams stats, or variations of certain pokemon to the total of the team.
![Sprite Click](/assets/readMePictures/Sprite_Click.png)
You can click a sprite to pull up individual stats, resistances, and weaknesses for a pokemon.
![Sprite Click Full](/assets/readMePictures/Sprite_Click_Full.png)
Slowly pokemon will have their pokedex entry updated to have a more complete sprite click section. It is only on very few pokemon at the moment but it is what I want the stat section to start to look like.
